            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 onion, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white wine</li>
            <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 (13.5 ounce) can artichoke hearts, drained  and chopped, liquid reserved</li>
            <li>1/4 cup capers, with liquid</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix together the flour, garlic powder, salt, 
                pepper, and Italian seasoning on a plate. </li>
            <li>One by one, dredge the chicken pieces lightly in the prepared
                flour mixture.</li>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
                Cook the chicken pieces for 2 minutes per side, or until nicely
                browned. Remove from the skillet and set aside.</li>
            <li>Using the same skillet, cook and stir the garlic and onion until
                translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour the white wine into the skillet, turn 
                the heat to high, and cook until the wine reduces by half, 4 to 5 
                minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken broth, lemon juice, artichoke hearts, reserved 
                artichock liquid, and browned chicken to the skillet.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium and cook until the sauce thickens, about 
                20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the capers and butter.</li>
            <li>Serve over pasta.</li>
        </ol>
